# Rules for Nathan's card guessing game #
In this game, the computer randomly picks a card from a standard deck of cards
(excluding jokers) and you have only 3 attempts to guess the correct card!

After each guess however, you'll be told whether you had;
- The correct suit
- Were within 5 numbers of the correct number
- Were within 2 numbers of the correct number
This should help you track down the correct card so use
your guesses wisely!

Note: When the computer asks for suit and number, keep in
mind that...
- Hearts = h 
- Diamonds = d 
- Spades = s
- Clubs = c
- 1,11,12,13 = Ace, Jack, Queen, King

Happy guessing! :D  2
