I got myself and my room mates to play test my game and the following adjustments were made based off of that testing
-> Changed difficulty from 4 -> 3 guesses (was too easy to pick a middle number and cheese the game with hints) 
-> Implimented game reset function within code (used to have to manually do it)
-> Fixed game reset function to reshuffle deck pick
